                    <p>Redeemed Christian Church of God ( RCCG) has its humble beginnings in Africa (Nigeria) through an encounter of one man with God. That man was Josiah O Akindayomi. Born not only into an idolatrous background but was surrounded by idol worshipers just like the patriarch, Abraham. But he was determined to please God and not partake of such abomination. This relentless pursue of righteousness lead him to encounter God. This encounter changed the course of his life for good. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Reverend Akindayomi though an unlettered man had a number of divine visitation. In one of such visitations, God Himself cast the vision for the church. And obtained a covenant establishing that the church would reach the ends of the earth with total gospel of salvation of Jesus Christ and still be flourishing when Christ shall come in glory. Premise upon this covenant the church started in 1952 as small band of praying men and metamorphosed into evangelical outreach post (to lost souls) called parish.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In early 70, God spoke to Pa Akindayomi about his successor during one of divine visitation. The Lord told him that this man, who was not a member of the church then, would be a young educated man. In 1973, when Enoch Adejare Adeboye joined the church, Rev Akindayomi was able to recognize him in the Spirit as the one that the Lord had spoken about in the past. He prepared necessarily and handed over to him in 1981. He served  fait and righteously to the end.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Pst. Enoch Adejare Adeboye took over the leadership of the church in 1981 as destined by God in the midst of many controversies but God, who called him and destined him, was with him. He forsook all ambition and academic appellation to obey God. His focus was to push God's agenda which is to take the gospel of salvation of Jesus Christ to all nations of the world. There was a revival under this leadership, that resulted in an explosion and exportation of of gospel of Jesus Christ.
